      Do you remember
      The 21st night of September?
      Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
      While chasin' the clouds away
      Our hearts were ringin'
      In the key that our souls were singin'
      As we danced in the night, remember
      How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah
      
      [Chorus]
      Hey, hey, hey
      Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
      Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
      [Post-Chorus]
      Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
      Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
      Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da
      
      [Verse 2]
      My thoughts are with you
      Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
      Only blue talk and love, remember
      How we knew love was here to stay
      Now December
      Found the love that we shared in September
      Only blue talk and love, remember
      The true love we share today
      
      [Chorus]
      Hey, hey, hey
      Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
      Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
      There was aâ€”
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
      
      [Bridge]
      The bell was ringin', oh, oh
      Our souls were singin'
      Do you remember never a cloudy day? Yow
      [Chorus]
      There was a
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), never was a cloudy day
      And we'll say
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
      Ba-dee-ya (Dee ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
      
      [Outro]
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
      Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!"
